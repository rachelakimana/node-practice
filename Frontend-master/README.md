### üë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èBest Practices

- Document your methods. Tip: [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/)
- Test your components & redux(No need for 100% coverage)

- Use design system approach to style your components (re-usable styling)
- When possible, use re-usable components
- Write a good README file with the steps to Install & run your web platform

### ‚ú®Bonus

- Have a Dockerized environment(Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
- Add a option to link a picture with a to-do item(File upload)
- Integrate with [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) where the todo items will be stored and retreived(Having same CRUD operations working with Firebase
- Add a search & filter option:
  - Search by todo's title
  - Filter by todos' priority or date of creation
